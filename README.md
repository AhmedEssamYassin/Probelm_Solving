# Problem solving roadmap for beginners

This repository is dedicated for students (or anyone) starting to train problem solving for competitions such as XCPC's or similar and contests such that on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/).
It contains problems on almost every topic you would like to train on such that:
- Input/Output
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Arrays
- Functions
- Strings
- Mathematics (sequences, summations, geometry)
- Recursion
- Prefix sum
- Frequency array
- STLS (vector, stack, queue, dequeue, set, map, ...etc.)
- Two pointer technique
- Binary search
- Bitmasks
- Number Theory (Too deep topics, detailed in separate point)
- Dynamic programming
- Segment tree
- Lazy propagation
- Binary indexed tree
- Sparse table
- Coordinate compression
- Graph theory
- Disjoint unions
- Suffix arrays

and so many topics to be added!

## How to follow up with this?
Just make sure to try solving each problem first and do not see the solutions until you do your best.
Good luck!
